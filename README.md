Hi. I'm Scott Zweydorff, a mathematician working to transition into software development. While in grad school I implemented various mathematical ideas mostly for myself, and I'm currently trying to make them more presentable, sometimes writing them in a new language. The ideas tend to fall into three categories: neural networks, cellular automata, and cryptography.
